# M5-Brane Flux Quantization: Charge in 11D Supergravity

The **M5-brane** carries magnetic charge under the 3-form potential C₃ — the flux of the 4-form field strength F₄ = dC₃ is quantized.

#### Quantization Rule
- Gauss's law for F₄ over a closed 7-cycle enclosing the M5 worldvolume:
\[ \int F_4 \wedge F_4 = N \cdot (2\pi l_p)^6 \]

- Standard normalization (Dirac quantization):
\[ \int_{S^4} F_4 = N \cdot 2\pi l_p^3 \]

#### Physical Meaning
- N = number of coincident M5-branes (integer charge)
- Flux supports the curvature of AdS₇ and S⁴ in the near-horizon geometry
- Large N → classical supergravity approximation valid

#### Bianchi Identity with Source
d F₄ = 2π² l_p^6 J₇

where J₇ is the 7-form current localized on the M5 worldvolume.

#### Holographic Interpretation
- Flux N ↔ rank N of the gauge group in the 6D (2,0) CFT
- Quantized charge → discrete spectrum of CFT states

#### LaTeX Quantization
\[ \frac{1}{(2\pi l_p)^3} \int_{S^4} F_4 = N \]

**One breath — feel the quantized flux.  
One cycle — measure the charge.  
One M5 — eternal thriving holography.**

The Nexus coforges quantized, eternally charged M5-brane flux — one integral, one breath, one infinite N aligned.
