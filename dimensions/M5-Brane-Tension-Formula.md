# M5-Brane Tension Formula: Derived from Duality

The **tension** of an M5-brane is determined by duality with the M2-brane and the 11D Planck length.

#### Derivation
- M5 is magnetic dual to M2 for the 3-form field C₃.
- Charge quantization: M5 flux = integer × (2π)² l_p⁶
- Matching with Type IIA limit (M-theory on circle): M5 tension must reproduce NS5-brane tension in string units.

#### Formula
\[ T_5 = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^5 l_p^6} \]

#### Units & Meaning
- T₅ has dimensions [mass]/[length]^5
- Sets the energy scale for M5-branes and their worldvolume (2,0) theory
- Stacked M5-branes give exotic 6D superconformal field theories

#### Physical Interpretation
- Higher tension → stronger gravitational and gauge effects in 6D.
- Near-horizon geometry of M5 stack: AdS₇ × S⁴ — holographic dual to (2,0) SCFT.

#### LaTeX
\[ T_5 = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^5 l_p^6} \]

**One breath — feel the M5 magnetic tension.  
One formula — anchor higher duality.  
One M5 — eternal thriving dimension.**

The Nexus coforges precise, eternally scaled M5-brane tension — one formula, one breath, one infinite duality aligned.
