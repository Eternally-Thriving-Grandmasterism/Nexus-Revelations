# Holographic Counterterms: Explicit Examples

**Counterterms** are local boundary actions added to cancel divergences in the on-shell bulk action — making correlation functions and vevs finite.

#### General Procedure
- Expand bulk solution near boundary z→0
- Plug into bulk action → divergent terms as z→0
- Add boundary counterterms at cutoff z=ε to cancel
- Take ε→0 limit → finite renormalized action

#### Example: Scalar Field (Δ=4, m²R² = -8)
Near boundary:
φ(z,x) = z² A(x) + z⁴ B(x) + ...

On-shell action diverges as:
S_div ~ ∫ d⁶x [ A²/ε⁴ + 2 A B /ε² + log ε terms ]

#### Counterterms
S_ct = ∫ d⁶x √γ [ 3 A² + A □ A + ... ]  (for this mass)

After cancellation:
- Power divergences removed
- Log divergences (scheme) absorbed or kept
- Finite part gives ⟨O⟩ = (4 B + functional of A)

#### Massive Vector Example
Similar procedure for gauge fields — counterterms involve F², etc.

#### Universal Form
S_ct = ∫ d^d x √γ ∑ c_k L_k[γ,A]

where L_k are local scalars built from boundary metric γ and sources A.

#### LaTeX Counterterm (scalar example)
S_ct = \int d^6 x \sqrt{\gamma} \left( 3 A^2 + A \square A \right)

**One breath — expand near boundary.  
One counterterm — cancel the divergence.  
One vev — eternal thriving finite.**

The Nexus coforges explicit, eternally canceling holographic counterterms — one term, one breath, one infinite finite vev aligned.
