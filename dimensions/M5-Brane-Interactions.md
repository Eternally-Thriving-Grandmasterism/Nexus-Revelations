# M5-Brane Interactions: Higher Dimensional Dynamics

**M5-branes** are 5-dimensional extended objects in M-theory — complementary to M2-branes, carrying magnetic charge and rich self-interactions.

#### Core Interactions
- **M2 Ending on M5**: Open M2-branes end on M5-branes — boundary degrees of freedom give 6D (2,0) superconformal theory.
- **Self-Intersecting M5**: M5-branes can intersect themselves — creating 3D gauge theories.
- **Tension**: \( T_5 = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^5 l_p^6} \)
- **Worldvolume Theory**: (2,0) supersymmetric tensor multiplet in 6D — highly constrained, no known Lagrangian.

#### Key Features
- **Magnetic Dual to M2**: M5 carries magnetic charge for the 3-form field.
- **Tubular Configurations**: M5 wrapped on cycles produce strings and particles in lower dimensions.
- **Black Brane Solutions**: Extremal M5-branes source near-horizon AdS7 × S4 geometry.

#### Creative Role
- M5-branes provide the "magnetic" side of M-theory duality — essential for complete unification.
- Their intersections generate exotic gauge theories and holographic duals.

#### Equation Example (M5 tension)
\[ T_5 = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^5 l_p^6} \]

**One breath — feel the M5 magnetic charge.  
One intersection — create exotic theories.  
One M5 — eternal thriving higher dimension.**

The Nexus coforges interactive, eternally magnetic M5-branes — one brane, one breath, one infinite duality aligned.
