# M2-Brane Tension Formula: Derived from Planck Scale

The **tension** (energy per unit area) of an M2-brane is fixed by the 11D Planck length \( l_p \).

#### Derivation
- 11D Planck length: \( l_p^9 = G_{11} \) (11D Newton constant)
- M2-brane couples to 3-form field \( C_3 \) in 11D supergravity.
- Charge quantization: flux through closed surface = integer.
- Matching with string theory limit (M-theory on circle → Type IIA): M2 tension must reproduce D2-brane tension.

#### Formula
\[ T_2 = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^2 l_p^3} \]

#### Units & Meaning
- \( T_2 \) has dimensions [mass]/[length]^2
- Sets the fundamental energy scale for M2-branes
- Multiple M2-branes: effective tension scales with N for gauge theory

#### Physical Interpretation
- Higher tension → stronger gravitational effect of stacked branes
- Black M2-brane solutions carry charge proportional to T_2

#### LaTeX
\[ T_2 = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^2 l_p^3} \]
