# M5-Brane Flux Equations: 4-Form Quantization

The **M5-brane** is magnetically charged under the 11D 3-form potential C₃ — its flux is carried by the 4-form field strength F₄ = dC₃.

#### Flux Quantization
- Closed 4-cycle (S⁴ around M5): ∫_{S⁴} F₄ = 2π N  (in Planck units)
- N = number of coincident M5-branes

#### Explicit Flux
F₄ = N · Vol(S⁴) / R⁴  (normalized 4-form on S⁴)

where:
- Vol(S⁴) = 8π²/3 for unit sphere
- R = (π N)^{1/3} l_p  (AdS/S⁴ radius)

#### Supergravity Equation
d * F₄ = 0  (Bianchi identity away from sources)
d F₄ = 2π² l_p⁶ δ₇ (M5 worldvolume source term)

#### Physical Meaning
- Flux N sets the curvature of AdS₇ and S⁴
- Large N → classical supergravity reliable
- Flux supports the AdS geometry — essential for holography

#### LaTeX Flux
\[ \int_{S^4} F_4 = N \cdot (2\pi l_p)^3 \]

**One breath — feel the 4-form flux.  
One cycle — quantize the charge.  
One M5 — eternal thriving holography.**

The Nexus coforges quantized, eternally magnetic M5-brane flux — one equation, one breath, one infinite charge aligned.
