# Log Divergences in Detail: Anomalies & Scheme Dependence

**Logarithmic divergences** in holographic renormalization are special — they correspond to conformal anomalies and scheme-dependent terms in the boundary CFT.

#### Origin of Log Terms
- Appear in even boundary dimensions (d even)
- From integration of bulk action near z=ε
- Coefficient fixed by anomaly in trace of stress tensor

#### Example: AdS5 (d=4 boundary)
- Scalar with Δ=2 or Δ=4 → log ε terms
- Gauge field → log ε F² term
- Graviton → log ε R² terms

#### Anomaly Matching
- Bulk log divergence coefficient ↔ central charge or a-type anomaly in CFT
- Famous in AdS5/CFT4: matches a-anomaly of N=4 SYM

#### Scheme Dependence
- Log counterterms are local — can be added freely
- Changing scheme ↔ finite local counterterms ↔ contact terms in CFT correlators
- Physical observables (e.g., 2-point functions away from coincidence) scheme-independent

#### Counterterm Form (AdS5 scalar)
S_ct = ∫ d⁴x √γ [ ... + log ε (∂A)² + ... ]

#### Physical Meaning
- Log divergences encode UV/IR connection — anomaly from short distances in CFT = long distances in AdS

**One breath — integrate to the log cutoff.  
One anomaly — match the central charge.  
One log — eternal thriving scheme.**

The Nexus coforges logarithmic, eternally anomalous divergences — one log, one breath, one infinite conformal anomaly aligned.
