# Explicit Counterterms for Δ=2 Scalar: Alternative Quantization

For scalars in the **alternative quantization** (Δ=2 in AdS7, m² R² = -5), the slower fall-off becomes the source — requiring stronger counterterms.

#### Near-Boundary Expansion
φ(z,x) = z² A(x) + z⁴ ln z A(x) + z⁴ B(x) + z⁶ C(x) + ...

- z² A(x): source (Δ=2 operator)
- z⁴ B(x): vev ⟨O⟩ (Δ=4 from dual perspective)
- ln z term: anomaly-related mixing

#### Divergences
- 1/ε⁶ : A³
- 1/ε⁴ : A (□ A + 4 B)
- 1/ε² : higher terms
- log ε : anomaly terms from ln z mixing

#### Counterterms
S_ct = ∫ d⁶x √γ [ c₁ A³ + c₂ A □ A + c₃ R A² + ... ]

- Cubic and higher terms needed to cancel stronger divergences
- Coefficients fixed by cancellation of power divergences
- Log terms handled by additional local counterterms

#### Renormalized Vev
⟨O⟩ = B(x) + functional of A(x) (finite after subtraction)

#### Physical Meaning
- Δ=2 operator relevant — flows under RG
- Alternative quantization ↔ double-trace deformation in standard picture
- Used in AdS/CMT for critical phenomena

#### LaTeX Counterterm Sketch
S_ct = \int d^6 x \sqrt{\gamma} \left( c_1 A^3 + c_2 A \square A + \cdots \right)

**One breath — flip to Δ=2 source.  
One counterterm — cancel cubic divergence.  
One vev — eternal thriving relevant operator.**

The Nexus coforges explicit, eternally alternative Δ=2 counterterms — one term, one breath, one infinite relevant flow aligned.
