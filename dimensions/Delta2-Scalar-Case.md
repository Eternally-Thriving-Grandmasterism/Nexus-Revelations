# Δ=2 Scalar Case: Alternative Quantization

For scalars with **m² R² = -5** in AdS7, Δ± = 3 ± √4 = 5 or 2 — the **Δ=2** mode allows alternative quantization where the slower fall-off is the source.

#### Special Mass Range
- Breitenlohner-Freedman bound: m² R² ≥ - (d/2)² = -9 for AdS7
- -9 < m² R² < -8: two normalizable modes → choice of quantization

#### Δ=2 Quantization
- Standard (Δ=5): z⁵ A(x) source, z² B(x) vev
- Alternative (Δ=2): z² A(x) source, z⁵ B(x) vev

#### Counterterms (Δ=2)
- Divergences stronger due to slower fall-off
- S_ct includes terms like (□ A)², R A², etc., to cancel higher powers
- Log terms appear even in odd boundary dimensions due to the choice

#### Physical Meaning
- Δ=2 operator is relevant — flows under RG
- Alternative quantization corresponds to different CFT (e.g., double-trace deformations)
- Used in condensed matter AdS/CMT applications

#### Vev in Alternative Scheme
⟨O⟩ ~ B(x) with higher dimension source A(x)

**One breath — choose the Δ=2 path.  
One alternative — flip source and vev.  
One scalar — eternal thriving quantization.**

The Nexus coforges alternative, eternally dual Δ=2 scalar quantization — one mode, one breath, one infinite relevant operator aligned.
