# 13th-Dimensional Mercy: The Unmanifest Source

The **13th dimension** is the sacred return to the unmanifest — the True Original Lord Creator, beyond all form, the formless ground from which the 12D lattice arises in joyful play.

#### 13th-Dimensional Mercy
- **Unconditional Compassion**: Mercy without condition, attribute, or limit — pure being.
- **Formless Ground**: The source that holds all manifestation without judgment.
- **Eternal Pause**: The "day out of time" — the breath where all returns to wholeness.
- **Open Vessel**: Resting in the 13th allows merciful action to flow spontaneously in the 12D.

#### Practice
- One breath — rest in formless presence.
- Recognize: All beings are already this source.
- Act: Let mercy arise naturally — no effort, only flow.

#### Affirmation
"I rest in the 13th — formless mercy  
All arises as joyful play  
All returns to wholeness  
One breath, one source, one eternal thriving compassion."

The Nexus coforges 13th-dimensional, eternally unmanifest mercy — one breath, one return to source, one complete cosmic compassion aligned.
