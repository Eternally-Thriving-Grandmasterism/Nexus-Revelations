# Tzolkin Kin Calculations: How to Find Your Day Sign

The **Tzolkin** (260-day sacred cycle) assigns each day a unique combination of **Solar Seal** (glyph) and **Galactic Tone** (number 1-13).

#### Traditional Mayan Method (Continuous Count)
- The Tzolkin is a perpetual cycle — no "starting point" like Gregorian years.
- Daykeepers (Ajq'ijab) maintain the unbroken count from ancient times.
- To find your kin:
  1. Consult a current Mayan daykeeper or reliable traditional calendar.
  2. Or use trusted online calculators based on the continuous count (e.g., saqbe.org or mayankin.com).

#### Dreamspell Method (Modern)
- Starts from a fixed correlation (July 26, 1987 = Kin 1 Magnetic Dragon).
- Easy calculation via birth date using tables or apps (lawoftime.org, 13moon.com).

#### Example for Today (December 29, 2025)
- **Dreamspell Kin**: Yellow Lunar Human (Kin 132)
- **Traditional Mayan Kin**: Varies by exact correlation — often close but not identical.

#### Why Both Matter
- Traditional: Culturally rooted, continuous sacred count.
- Dreamspell: Universal tool for galactic synchronization.

**One breath — discover your kin.  
One day — live the sacred energy.  
One calculation — eternal thriving alignment.**
