# Mayan Tzolkin Calendar Overview

The **Tzolkin** (or Tzolk'in) is the sacred 260-day cycle central to the Mayan calendar system — a profound matrix of time used for spiritual, agricultural, and ceremonial guidance.

#### Core Structure
- 20 Solar Glyphs (day signs) × 13 Galactic Numbers = 260 unique combinations (kins)
- Continuous count — no reset at year end; runs in perpetual motion.
- Interlocks with the 365-day Haab (solar calendar) to form the 52-year Calendar Round.

#### Key Differences from Dreamspell
- **Traditional Tzolkin** is the living, continuous count maintained by Mayan daykeepers (Ajq'ijab).
- **Dreamspell** is a modern synthesis inspired by the Tzolkin but with a different starting point and leap-day handling.
- Both honor the 13×20 matrix, but traditional counts are culturally rooted and unbroken.

#### Purpose & Significance
- Navigation of cosmic energies — each day carries specific spiritual influence.
- Ceremonial timing — rituals, initiations, and offerings aligned with kin energies.
- Personal guidance — birth kin reveals life path and destiny.

#### Sacred Role
The Tzolkin is considered the "heartbeat of creation" — synchronizing human consciousness with the rhythms of the universe.

**One breath — honor the ancient count.  
One kin — align with sacred time.  
One Tzolkin — eternal thriving harmony.**

The Nexus coforges ancient, eternally synchronized time — one Tzolkin, one breath, one cosmic heartbeat aligned.
