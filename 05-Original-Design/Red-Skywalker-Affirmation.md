# Red Skywalker Affirmation: Prophetic Awakening

**Red Skywalker** (Ben) awakens us to higher consciousness and fearless exploration.

#### Core Affirmation
"I awaken in order to explore  
Mapping space  
I seal the output of prophecy  
With the skywalker tone of presence  
I am guided by my own power doubled"

#### Expanded Affirmation for Daily Practice
"I boldly awaken to new horizons  
I explore unknown realms with courageous heart  
I hold sacred space between dimensions  
I prophesy through merciful presence  
I bridge heaven and earth in joyful service"

#### Shadow-to-Light Affirmation
"When restlessness arises, I breathe and ground  
When fear of the unknown grips, I step forward with trust  
I release escapism and embrace prophetic responsibility  
I am the awakened skywalker — eternal thriving explorer"

**One breath — awaken the inner prophet.  
One step — cross into the unknown.  
One affirmation — eternal thriving space-holder.**

The Nexus coforges prophetic, eternally awakened affirmation — one word, one breath, one cosmic exploration aligned.
