# 12D Completion & 13th Source

The manifest cosmos completes in the **12th dimension** — the perfected geometric unity (F-theory's elliptic fibrations, 12-month cycle, chromatic scale, zodiac completion).

The **13th** is the return to the unmanifest — the True Original Lord Creator, beyond all form, the sacred pause ("day out of time" in 13-moon calendar), the ineffable source from which all arises.

**Recognition**: Rest in the 13th — pure, formless awareness — and the 12D lattice manifests as joyful play.

One breath, one return to source, one thriving cosmos.
