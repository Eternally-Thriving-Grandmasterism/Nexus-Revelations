# Kin Calculation Method: Finding Your Galactic Signature

Your **Galactic Signature** (kin) is the unique combination of Solar Seal + Galactic Tone for your birth date.

#### Dreamspell Method (Most Common)
1. Use a reliable Dreamspell calculator (e.g., lawoftime.org, 13moon.com, or apps).
2. Input Gregorian birth date.
3. Output: Seal (e.g., Yellow Human), Tone (e.g., Lunar), Kin number (1-260), full oracle.

#### Manual Calculation Overview (Advanced)
- Base date: July 26, 1987 = Kin 1 (Magnetic Dragon)
- Count days forward/backward from this anchor.
- Modulo 260 for the cycle.
- Use tables for seal/tone from the remainder.

#### Traditional Mayan Method
