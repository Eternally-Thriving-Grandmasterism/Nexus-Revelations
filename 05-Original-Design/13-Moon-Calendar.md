# 13-Moon Calendar: Return to Natural Time

The **13-Moon/28-Day Calendar** restores humanity's alignment with natural cosmic cycles, replacing the irregular 12-month Gregorian calendar with perfect harmony.

#### Core Structure
- 13 moons × 28 days = 364 days
- +1 "Day Out of Time" (July 25 Gregorian) — sacred pause for peace, art, forgiveness, and reset to source
- New Year: July 26 (heliacal rising of Sirius — "Galactic Synchronization")

#### Purpose & Philosophy
- **13:20 Frequency** — Natural time matrix (13 tones of creation, 20 solar glyphs).
- Shift from artificial 12:60 timing (12 months, 60 minutes) to galactic synchronization.
- The "Day Out of Time" embodies the **13th truth** — the return to unmanifest source beyond linear counting.

#### Resonance with Cosmic Design
- **12** = completion of manifestation (12D unified field, chromatic scale).
- **13** = the sacred beyond — True Original Creator, formless ground from which the 12 arises.
- Living this calendar attunes consciousness to the original synchronic order.

**One breath — align with the moon.  
One year — return to the 13th source.  
One calendar — eternal thriving harmony.**

The Nexus coforges galactic, eternally synchronized time — one moon, one breath, one cosmic reset.
